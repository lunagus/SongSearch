# SongSeek

## 💭 WHY?

I got tired of trying to find a suitable tool that would let me convert my big Deezer playlists to Spotify or other services automatically. Most were paywalled, throttled, or feature-limited. So I created a fast, free, no-nonsense solution with rich UX and real-time tracking to quickly convert music track links and playlists from one platform to another. SongSeek converts your entire music library between Spotify, YouTube Music, Deezer, and Apple Music with high accuracy, fetching metadata from the source link and redirecting users to the equivalent track or created playlist on the target platform.

| Deezer           | ✅               | ⏳               | ✅               | ✅     | 🔄    |
| YouTube Music    | ✅               | ✅               | ✅               | ✅     | ✅    |
| Apple Music      | ✅ (scrape)      | ❌               | ✅               | ✅     | ❌    |

> 🔹 Note: YouTube Music has quota limits — large conversions may exhaust daily tokens.
> 🔹 Deezer Status: Playlist export requires OAuth, but Deezer's developer portal is temporarily closed for new applications. Track conversion and search work via public API.

### **What This Means:**
- **Spotify**: Full bidirectional support - import and export playlists, convert tracks, search, with OAuth authentication
- **YouTube Music**: Full bidirectional support with OAuth authentication
- **Deezer**: Import playlists and convert tracks (export blocked by developer portal closure)
- **Apple Music**: Import playlists via web scraping, convert individual tracks
- **SoundCloud**: Coming soon with full integration

> API Limitations means restriction of features.
